I am an accountant by profession, but over the past year, I have been drawn towards technology and have become a self-learner. This has allowed me to develop skills that have helped me persevere, study, and realize that anything can be learned as long as one has the right mindset and a suitable growth environment, making learning second nature. Currently, I work as a software developer, with expertise in both web and mobile development and knowledge of clean architecture. Additionally, I was working as a programming coach, helping to open up opportunities for people, especially those who are looking to make a career change. I am passionate about creating solutions and guiding people to reach their full potential.

I have always been inclined towards projects that have social impact since I feel committed to better my community and the people that live in it. Therefore, I also enjoy working in teams and consider myself to have excellent soft skills as a professional. I believe that my ability to communicate, collaborate and empathize with others is just as important as my technical expertise. Whether working with clients, colleagues or other stakeholders or involved parties, I strive to create a positive and supportive environment that fosters mutual respect, trust and collaboration. Ultimately, I believe that success in any field is a team effort, and I am always eager to contribute my skills and experience towards achieving common goals.
