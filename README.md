- 📫 How to reach me ...

I am an accountant; but during the last year; I leaned towards technology and became a self-learner; which helped me develop skills allowing me to persevere, study and realize that anything could be learned as long as one has the right mindset and a suitable growth environment making learning second nature. Currently, I am working as a programming coach helping to open opportunities for people; especially those who are looking into changing careers. I am passionate about creating solutions and guiding people to reach their full potential.

I have always been inclined towards projects that have social impact since I feel committed to better my community and the people that live in it. Therefore, I feel at ease working in teams and leading projects.
